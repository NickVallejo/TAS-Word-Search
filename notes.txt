current version loops through every possible path that could be taken, and every line that could be drawn from an adjacent square
this is because the algorithm only stops if it hits a wall. It does not stop if a word is not found.
initially, we wanted to continue the path in the event that a path may write a word later in the iteration
now it might make sense to stop the iteration if a word does in the dic does not begin with the letters
if (begins with letters) do x, if not return
